# Changelog

All notable changes to Cortex will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Shared credentials file at `~/.pyre/credentials.json` — one login per machine signs the user into Cortex, Engram, and Persona. Cortex extends the existing engram/persona shape with an additive `cortex.tenants[]` section, forward-compatible with the multi-tenant login flow.
- One-time migration from the legacy `~/.config/cortex/credentials.json` location. Runs on first credentials read; idempotent.
- 23 vitest cases covering credential round-trip, env-var precedence, active-tenant fallback, partial logout, and all migration paths.

### Changed
- `cortex login` now requires the pyre-web URL via positional arg, `--server` flag, or `PYRE_API_URL` env var. The previous `DEFAULT_LOGIN_SERVER = "https://getpyre.ai"` hardcode has been removed per the no-hardcoded-environment-URLs policy.
- `cortex logout` now removes only Cortex's section of the shared credentials file. Engram and Persona credentials are preserved.
- Auth code lives at `packages/server/src/auth/` (mirrors engram's layout) instead of `packages/server/src/cli/`.

### Removed
- `packages/server/src/cli/credentials.ts` and `packages/server/src/cli/login.ts` (replaced by the `auth/` modules).
- `CORTEX_LOGIN_SERVER` env var (no longer needed — `PYRE_API_URL` takes its place per the shared convention).
