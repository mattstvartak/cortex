# Cortex

A personal work-knowledge assistant that unifies meeting transcripts, docs, code,
and personal notes into a searchable, context-aware system. Built as an
orchestration layer on top of Engram (memory) and Persona (communication style).

## What This Project Is

Cortex ingests from Loom, Confluence, Bitbucket, and Obsidian. It runs meeting
transcripts through a multi-pass extraction pipeline to produce digestible briefs.
It generates pre-meeting briefs from calendar events. It tracks action items
across projects. It exposes all of this through an MCP server that Claude Code
and Claude.ai connect to.

It is explicitly designed around the author's ADHD — summarization, prioritization,
and connection to existing context are first-class features, not afterthoughts.

## What This Project Is NOT

- Not a fork of Engram or Persona. Those are consumed as MCP services.
- Not a general-purpose memory system. That's Engram's job.
- Not a communication-style learner. That's Persona's job.
- Not a replacement for Claude Code or Claude.ai. Those are the interfaces.

                    Bitbucket, Obsidian,
                    Calendar)
```

Cortex exposes domain-specific tools (projects, meetings, briefs, action items).
Internally it calls Engram's MCP for storage/retrieval and Persona's MCP for
style adaptation. Source adapters pull data from external services and route
it through extraction pipelines before ingesting into Engram with structured
metadata.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for detailed component responsibilities and data flow.

## Core Concepts

**Project**: A unit of work with its own context, people, and content. Cortex
tracks a dozen+ concurrently. Defined in `config/projects.yaml`.

**Source**: Where content originated. One of: `loom`, `confluence`, `bitbucket`,
`obsidian`, `calendar`. Stored as metadata on every ingested memory.

**Type**: What kind of content. One of: `meeting`, `decision`, `action_item`,
`doc`, `code`, `note`, `brief`, `digest`.

**Brief**: A digestible summary designed for quick reading. Produced by the
meeting pipeline and the pre-meeting brief generator.

**Action Item**: A commitment extracted from a meeting or note. Tracked in a
unified queue across all projects. Owner, source, status, optional due date.

## Memory Metadata Contract

Every memory ingested into Engram must carry the following metadata:

```json
{
  "domain": "work",
  "source": "loom | confluence | bitbucket | obsidian | calendar",
  "source_id": "stable-id-from-source",
  "source_url": "https://...",
  "project": "project-slug | [project-a, project-b]",
  "type": "meeting | decision | action_item | doc | code | note | brief | digest",
  "people": ["person-slug", "..."],
  "date": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
  "confidence": "0.0 to 1.0 (for inferred fields like project tagging)"
}
```

This contract is load-bearing. Cortex's search tools filter on these fields.
Breaking it silently breaks retrieval quality.

See `schemas/memory-metadata.json` for the authoritative schema.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript (matches Engram and Persona)
- **MCP SDK**: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
- **Engram/Persona**: consumed over MCP, not imported
- **LLM for pipelines**: pluggable provider layer. Toggle between local
  (Ollama) and BYOK cloud providers (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or
  any OpenAI-compatible endpoint). Configurable per pipeline step, with a
  fallback chain. See ADR-004 and ADR-010.
- **Calendar**: Google Calendar API
- **Loom**: Loom API
- **Confluence/Bitbucket**: Atlassian APIs
- **Obsidian**: direct filesystem watch on the vault
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Runtime**: Node 20+

## Repo Structure

Monorepo with pnpm workspaces. Each adapter, pipeline, and the server itself
is a separate package. See ADR-008.

## Conventions

**Prompts live as markdown files in `packages/pipeline-*/src/prompts/`.** Never
inline prompts in code. Makes them reviewable, diffable, and improvable without
touching logic. See ADR-007.

**Every adapter has the same shape**: `fetch`, `transform`, `classify`,
`ingest`. Don't invent new structures per source.

**Every ingestion path is idempotent.** Re-running an adapter on the same
content updates existing memories, never duplicates. Use `source_id` as the
dedup key via Engram's duplicate detection.

**Secrets live in `.env`, never in config files.** Config files are checked
in; `.env` is not. `.env.example` shows required variables.

**One MCP tool per file.** Tools are independently testable.

**Tests alongside code where practical.** Integration tests that hit real
Engram/Persona use docker-compose for setup.

## Build Order

See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the canonical, up-to-date order and current state.
Summary:

1. Monorepo foundation, typed Engram/Persona clients, Ollama + OpenRouter
   clients, empty MCP server
2. Project taxonomy (config + `list_projects` + `get_project_context` tools)
3. Meeting pipeline on fixtures (3-pass: structural -> synthesis -> brief)
4. Loom adapter (applies pipeline to real data)
5. Confluence adapter
6. Pre-meeting briefs (Google Calendar)
7. Daily digest
8. Action item tracking UX
9. Obsidian adapter (deferred — no notes yet)
10. Bitbucket adapter

Each step should be independently useful. Don't build #10 before #5 works.

## What Claude Code Should Not Do

- Do not import Engram or Persona code directly. They are consumed over MCP.
- Do not commit `.env`, API keys, or any secrets.
- Do not modify the memory metadata contract without updating every adapter
  and this file.
- Do not add new cognitive layers to Engram from here. Propose those upstream
  to the Engram repo.
- Do not mix work-specific logic into the Engram or Persona clients. Those
  are thin wrappers.
- Do not use prompts inline; keep them in `packages/pipeline-*/src/prompts/`.
- Do not skip tests on ingestion adapters. They fail silently and corrupt
  retrieval quality.
- Do not guess at project or people taxonomy. Read `config/projects.yaml`
  and `config/people.yaml`. If missing info, ask.

## When Claude Code Starts a Session

1. Read this file (CLAUDE.md).
2. Read `docs/ROADMAP.md` for current state.
3. Read `docs/DECISIONS.md` for prior architectural decisions.
4. If working on a specific source adapter, read that adapter's README.
5. Ask what task to work on. Don't assume continuity from last session.

## Owner / Context

Single-user project, private repo. Author has ADHD and works across a dozen
concurrent projects at a new job. The system is the author's daily driver,
so reliability and low cognitive overhead are paramount. Features that require
constant manual curation will not be used and therefore should not be built.
