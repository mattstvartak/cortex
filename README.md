# Cortex

Work-knowledge MCP server. Unifies docs (Confluence, Notion), tickets
(Jira), personal notes (Obsidian) — and later meetings, code, email,
and chat — into a single searchable layer Claude Code and Claude.ai
can query.

Built as an orchestration layer on top of two standalone MCP servers:

- [**@onenomad/engram-memory**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@onenomad/engram-memory) — memory, hybrid search, knowledge graph
- [**@onenomad/persona-mcp**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@onenomad/persona-mcp) — evolving personality, style signals

Cortex adds domain-specific MCP tools (projects, meetings, briefs,
action items, research) and modular source adapters. Every adapter
and LLM provider is a standalone package — install only what you use.

## Status

Two MCP tools live (`list_projects`, `get_project_context`). Five source
adapters shipped — Confluence, Jira, Linear, Notion, Obsidian — all
sharing `@cortex/pipeline-doc`. The 3-pass meeting extraction pipeline
(`@cortex/pipeline-meeting`) is live with prompts as `.md` files; Loom
adapter slots on next. 83 tests. `cortex sync <adapter>` runs a full
ingestion cycle on demand — the LLM router is now wired in, so any
adapter that declares pipeline-meeting runs end-to-end. See
[`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) for what's next.

## Install

```bash
# Global install (once published)
npm install -g @onenomad/cortex

# Or develop locally
git clone https://github.com/mattstvartak/cortex.git
cd cortex
pnpm install
```

## First-run setup

Run the interactive wizard. It detects whether Engram and Persona are
installed globally, offers to install the missing ones, auto-installs
local Ollama if you pick it, and writes `.env` + `config/cortex.yaml`.

```bash
cortex init
```

The wizard:

1. Probes `persona-mcp` and `engram-memory` on PATH; `npm install -g`s any missing.
2. If you pick Ollama local: detects `ollama`, offers to auto-install
   (winget / brew / shell script), waits for the daemon, pulls the
   chosen model.
3. Prompts for LLM providers, API keys, host.
4. Writes config (backs up any existing versions with `.bak.<ts>`).
5. Runs a live smoke test.

## Commands

```bash
cortex init                 # interactive setup wizard
cortex start                # boot the MCP server over stdio
cortex smoke                # live probe of every enabled LLM provider
cortex sync <adapter>       # run one adapter's full ingestion cycle
  --since=ISO                 only items updated after this date
  --limit=N                   cap items processed
  --dry-run                   don't write to Engram
cortex help
```

## Source adapters

| Adapter | Status | Auth | Reuses |
|---|---|---|---|
| `@cortex/adapter-confluence` | ✅ shipped | Atlassian token | `pipeline-doc` |
| `@cortex/adapter-jira` | ✅ shipped | Atlassian token (same) | `pipeline-doc` |
| `@cortex/adapter-linear` | ✅ shipped | `LINEAR_API_KEY` | `pipeline-doc` |
| `@cortex/adapter-notion` | ✅ shipped | `NOTION_API_KEY` | `pipeline-doc` |
| `@cortex/adapter-obsidian` | ✅ shipped | (filesystem) | `pipeline-doc` |
| `@cortex/adapter-loom` | next up | `LOOM_API_KEY` | `pipeline-meeting` ✅ ready |
| `@cortex/adapter-google-calendar` | planned | Google OAuth | `pipeline-event` |
| `@cortex/adapter-google-drive` | planned | Google OAuth | `pipeline-doc` |
| `@cortex/adapter-gmail` | planned | Google OAuth | `pipeline-email` |
| `@cortex/adapter-bitbucket` | planned | Atlassian token | `pipeline-code` |
| `@cortex/adapter-github` | planned | GitHub PAT | `pipeline-code` |
| `@cortex/adapter-slack` | planned | Slack token | `pipeline-conversation` |

Enabling an adapter is a three-step flip:

```yaml
# config/cortex.yaml
adapters:
  confluence:
    enabled: true            # 1. flip on
    config:
      workspace: "yourco"    # 2. tell it where
      spaces: ["ENG"]
      spaceToProject:
        ENG: engineering
```

```bash
# .env — 3. credentials
ATLASSIAN_EMAIL=you@example.com
ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN=...
```

Then `cortex sync confluence --dry-run --limit=5` to preview, drop the
flags to actually ingest.

## LLM providers

Pluggable — toggle between local Ollama, OpenRouter, or BYOK direct
providers (Anthropic/OpenAI/Google) per-task via
`config/cortex.yaml > llm.tasks`. See [ADR-010](docs/DECISIONS.md).

Current provider packages:

- `@cortex/provider-ollama` — local (Ollama, any model it supports; `think: false` by default)
- `@cortex/provider-openrouter` — BYOK cloud aggregator

Future: `@cortex/provider-anthropic`, `@cortex/provider-openai`,
`@cortex/provider-google` for direct-provider BYOK.

## Connect to Claude Code

Add this to your Claude Code MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cortex": {
      "command": "cortex",
      "args": ["start"]
    }
  }
}
```

Reload Claude Code. `cortex` should appear in `/mcp` with the two tools
currently shipped.

```

Every adapter implements the same `SourceAdapter` contract. Every LLM
provider implements the same `LLMProvider` contract. Every pipeline
implements the same `Pipeline` contract. All three layers are loaded
from config at startup, so swapping or disabling any piece is a config
edit — not a code change.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full story
including the 3-pass meeting extraction pipeline, classification
strategy, and failure-mode handling.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install              # install all workspace deps
pnpm typecheck            # tsc --build across the monorepo
pnpm test                 # unit tests (71 and counting)
pnpm dev                  # run `cortex start` in watch mode
pnpm smoke                # live provider smoke test
```

Workspace layout is described in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). Architectural
decisions that shaped this structure are in
[`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md) (ADRs).
