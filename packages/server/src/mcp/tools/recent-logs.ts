 *      written by createLogger's appendToDisk path).
 *
 * Why both: the ring is fast + always fresh, but resets every time
 * Cortex MCP is killed (every Pyre restart, every dev iteration). The
 * disk file survives but has a small write-buffer latency. Reading
 * both + de-duping by ts+msg gets the best of both — historical
 * context AND current liveness.
 *
 * Pyre's Activity sub-tab polls this every few seconds with `since`
 * = the last seen ts; lines persist across Pyre sessions because the
 * disk file does.
