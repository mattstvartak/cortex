/**
 * Cortex's local embedder.
 *
 * Wraps @huggingface/transformers with the Xenova MiniLM-L6-v2 model
 * (384-dim, ~23MB, runs on CPU). Replaces the previous design where
 * Cortex called out to an LLM provider for embeddings — Cortex is
 * now self-sufficient: pgvector + this embedder = full memory stack
 * with no external runtime deps.
 *
 * Why MiniLM-L6-v2: same model Engram uses, so any tooling that
 * compares embeddings across the two systems works without re-
 * embedding. Lightweight enough to run on a VPS without a GPU,
 * which matches Cortex's hosted-deploy story.
 *
 * Lazy-loaded — the first embed() call triggers the ~5s model load
 * + (on first run) the ~23MB download from HuggingFace. Subsequent
 * calls are sub-100ms per chunk on modern hardware.
 *
 * Engram is intentionally NOT a runtime dep here — Engram lives
 * with Pyre as per-user memory; Cortex's memory backend stays
 * entirely separate so Cortex deploys remotely as a single artifact.
